## Description:

This Relational DataBase, made in SQL, is a project made for Clube de Programacao, an student initiative, from SENAI CIMATEC and as a end of Database subject project. Its been developed by members of the club with the purpose for acting as a managent tool for the activites conducted on the initiative. Members, tournaments, workshops... those datas are the things the Database is going to store.

## The Future:

We plan to get these DataBase as a studie objet for other members that want to study SQL and Data Modeling. Besides that we also plan to conect the database with our Website, that we will create on the Future. 

## Documentation:
*All DataBase Documentation  is also present at and .pdf arquive on the Repository. 

1. The Conceptual Data Model
	The following is the conceptual data model, in which the database is represented in a more superficial and abstract way, to facilitate general understanding. The model was developed using the DER (Entity Relationship Diagram) methodology.
